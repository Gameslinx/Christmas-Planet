A planet for KSP during this festive time!

As a present from myself to the community, I decided to create a Christmas themed planet. This planet, called "The Snowball" orbits Kerbol just beyond Jool.

The planet has a radius of 500km with an atmosphere 50km high. It harbours an ocean, clouds, rings, and a multitude of aurorae. I have spent a long time developing the assets that are being used on this planet!
